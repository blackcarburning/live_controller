# show-sync Timeline Editor — Usage Notes

## Overview

`show-sync-editor.py` is a standalone timeline-based editor for composing
light/display shows that are played back through the **show-sync** web client.
It replaces the previous simple effect-list approach with a proper
multitrack-style editor complete with draggable clips, resize handles, a
WYSIWYG preview, and `.mov` video reference.

---

## Launching the editor

```bash
# Blank show
python show-sync-editor.py

# Open an existing show file
python show-sync-editor.py my-show.json
```

The editor starts a local HTTP server on **http://127.0.0.1:5556** and opens
your default browser automatically.  Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop
the server.

---

## Loading a .mov reference video

1. Click **Load .mov** in the toolbar, *or*
2. Drag and drop a `.mov` (or `.mp4`, `.mkv`, etc.) file onto the video player.

The video appears in the **Reference Video** panel on the right.  Its duration
is used to set the timeline length.

You can also type a filename directly into the video path field if you prefer
to use a server-side path (the `/video?path=…` endpoint serves the file with
range-request support for seeking).

---

## Transport controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **▶ Play / ⏸ Pause** button | Play or pause the reference video |
| **Spacebar** | Toggle play/pause (when no text field is focused) |
| Scrub bar | Drag to seek; timeline playhead follows |
| Click on the timeline ruler | Seek to that position |
| **Drag on the timeline ruler** | Continuously scrub the playhead — hold mouse button and drag left or right to scrub; the video and preview update in real time |

---

## Creating clips

Use the **Add** buttons in the timeline toolbar to create a clip at the current
playhead position:

| Button | Clip type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **+ Solid** | `color` | Fills the screen with a solid colour for the duration |
| **+ Text** | `text` | Displays centred text above the colour layer |
| **+ Fade In** | `fade_in` | Fades from black into a colour over the duration |
| **+ Fade Out** | `fade_out` | Fades from a colour back to black over the duration |
| **+ Strobe** | `strobe` | Rapid on/off flashing at a configurable rate (Hz) |
| **+ Pulse** | `pulse` | Sine-wave opacity pulsing at a configurable rate (Hz) |
| **+ Glitch** | `glitch` | Position-jitter/shake effect with configurable intensity |
| **+ Blur In** | `blur` | Starts heavily blurred and sharpens to full clarity over the clip |
| **+ Sweep** | `color_sweep` | A colour that sweeps across the screen (four directions) |
| **+ Bounce** | `bounce` | Vertical sine-wave bounce at a configurable rate and amplitude |
| **+ Shake** | `shake` | Horizontal rapid shake at a configurable rate and amplitude |
| **+ Zoom** | `zoom_pulse` | Scale in/out pulsing at a configurable rate and amount |
| **+ HueRot** | `hue_rotate` | Continuously rotates the display hue at a configurable rate |
| **+ Glow** | `neon_glow` | Pulsing neon drop-shadow glow at a configurable size and rate |

Solid / fade clips go on the **Solids** track (layer 1).
Text clips go on the **Text** track (layer 10 — rendered on top).

---

## Moving and resizing clips

- **Drag the clip body** left or right to move it in time.
- **Drag the left edge handle** to change the clip's start time (and
  consequently its duration).
- **Drag the right edge handle** to change the clip's end time (duration).
- **Click a clip** to select it; selected clips are highlighted with a white
  outline.
- **Delete / Backspace** removes the selected clip.

---

## Editing clip properties

When a clip is selected, the **properties bar** at the bottom shows:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | Change the clip type (all fourteen types listed above) |
| **Start (s)** | Exact start time in seconds |
| **Duration (s)** | Length of the clip in seconds |
| **Beats (N BPM) →** | One-click beat presets: ¼ / ½ / 1 / 2 / 4 beats at the show's current BPM — sets Duration instantly |
| **Colour** | Background / text colour (colour picker) |
| **Text** | *(text clips only)* The text string to display |
| **Size (vmin)** | *(text clips only)* Font size in `vmin` units (1–30) |

| **Rate (Hz)** | *(strobe / pulse / bounce / shake / zoom_pulse / hue_rotate / neon_glow)* Cycles or flashes per second |
| **Intensity (px)** | *(glitch only)* Maximum pixel offset for the jitter |
| **Max Blur (px)** | *(blur only)* Starting blur radius in pixels (reduces to 0 over the clip) |
| **Direction** | *(color_sweep only)* Sweep direction: → Left→Right, ← Right→Left, ↓ Top→Bottom, ↑ Bottom→Top |
| **Amplitude (px)** | *(bounce / shake only)* Peak displacement in pixels |
| **Amount** | *(zoom_pulse only)* Scale variation per cycle (0.2 = ±20% size change) |
| **Glow Size (px)** | *(neon_glow only)* Peak drop-shadow radius in pixels |
| **Fade In (s)** | Ramp-up time at the start of the clip (0 = instant) |
| **Fade Out (s)** | Ramp-down time at the end of the clip (0 = instant) |

## Five new live-show effects

The following effect types were added for live-performance contexts.  They are
available from the **FX** buttons in the timeline toolbar and from the **Type**
dropdown in the properties bar.

### 1 — Strobe (`strobe`)

Rapid on/off flashing at a configurable frequency.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ffffff` | Flash colour |
| `rate` | `10` | Flashes per second (Hz) — each flash = one on + one off cycle |

**Live rendering:** toggles the display between `color` and black at `rate` Hz
with a 50 % duty cycle (equal on/off time).  Fade in/out is applied as an
opacity envelope across the whole clip.

### 2 — Pulse (`pulse`)

Smooth sine-wave opacity cycling.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ffffff` | Pulse colour |
| `rate` | `1` | Full oscillation cycles per second (Hz) |

**Live rendering:** opacity = `0.5 + 0.5 × sin(2π × pos × rate)` — ranges from
0 to 1 over each cycle, creating a smooth breathing or heartbeat effect.

### 3 — Glitch (`glitch`)

Rapid position-jitter using deterministic pseudo-random offsets.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ff4040` | Fill colour during jitter |
| `intensity` | `8` | Maximum pixel displacement (x and y) |

**Live rendering:** applies `transform: translate(dx, dy)` each frame where
`dx = sin(pos × 137.5) × intensity` and `dy = cos(pos × 89.3) × intensity`.
The displacement is multiplied by the fade-in/fade-out opacity envelope so the
jitter can be ramped in or out naturally.

### 4 — Blur In (`blur`)

Screen starts heavily blurred and gradually sharpens to full clarity.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ffffff` | Background colour shown through the blur |
| `max_blur` | `20` | Starting blur radius in pixels; decreases linearly to 0 |

**Live rendering:** applies `filter: blur(Npx)` where N decreases from
`max_blur` to 0 over the clip duration.  Combine with a `fade_out` clip
underneath for a sharp→blurry-exit effect.

### 5 — Color Sweep (`color_sweep`)

A solid colour that sweeps across the screen from one side.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ff0000` | Sweep colour |
| `direction` | `lr` | `lr` left→right, `rl` right→left, `tb` top→bottom, `bt` bottom→top |

**Live rendering:** uses `clip-path: inset(…)` to reveal the colour block
progressively from 0 % to 100 % over the clip duration.

---

## Five additional live-show effects (2nd set)

The following five effect types extend the available FX palette.  They are
available from the **FX** buttons in the timeline toolbar and from the **Type**
dropdown in the properties bar.

### 6 — Bounce (`bounce`)

Colour block that bounces vertically using a sine-wave displacement.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ff4080` | Fill colour |
| `rate` | `1` | Bounce cycles per second (Hz) |
| `amplitude` | `30` | Peak vertical displacement in pixels |

**Live rendering:** applies `transform: translateY(…px)` each frame where the
offset = `sin(2π × pos × rate) × amplitude × opacity_envelope`.

### 7 — Shake (`shake`)

Rapid horizontal shake — useful for impact hits and stingers.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#8040c0` | Fill colour |
| `rate` | `4` | Shake cycles per second (Hz) |
| `amplitude` | `15` | Peak horizontal displacement in pixels |

**Live rendering:** applies `transform: translateX(…px)` with a sine function,
scaled by the fade-in/fade-out envelope.

### 8 — Zoom Pulse (`zoom_pulse`)

Rhythmically scales the display in and out like a heartbeat or camera zoom.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#40c080` | Fill colour |
| `rate` | `1` | Scale cycles per second (Hz) |
| `amount` | `0.2` | Scale variation (0.2 = ±20 % size per cycle) |

**Live rendering:** applies `transform: scale(…)` where scale = `1 + amount × sin(2π × pos × rate)`.

### 9 — Hue Rotate (`hue_rotate`)

Continuously cycles the display colour through the full hue wheel.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#ff6000` | Base colour (rotated through 360 °) |
| `rate` | `0.5` | Full hue-wheel revolutions per second |

**Live rendering:** applies `filter: hue-rotate(Ndeg)` where N = `pos × rate × 360` (mod 360),
producing a smooth rainbow colour-cycling effect.

### 10 — Neon Glow (`neon_glow`)

Pulsing neon drop-shadow glow — great for logo reveals and transitions.

| Param | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `color` | `#00d0ff` | Glow and fill colour |
| `size` | `20` | Peak glow radius in pixels |
| `rate` | `2` | Glow pulse cycles per second (Hz) |

**Live rendering:** applies `filter: drop-shadow(0 0 Npx color)` where N = `size × (0.5 + 0.5 × sin(2π × pos × rate))`,
ranging from 0 to `size` px over each cycle.

---

## BPM-aware timing

### Setting the show BPM

The **BPM** field in the toolbar (default **120**) stores the tempo in the
show file (`show.bpm`).  It is used exclusively for the beat-duration helper;
it does not affect the audio or video playback rate.

When you load a show file that contains a `bpm` key, the input is updated
automatically.  When you start a new show, it resets to 120.

### Beat-duration presets

When a clip is selected, the properties bar shows a row of beat-duration
buttons labelled **¼ ½ 1 2 4**.  Clicking one sets the clip's **Duration (s)**
field to the equivalent number of seconds at the current BPM:

```
duration_seconds = round(beats × 60 / BPM × 1000) / 1000
```

| Button | Beats | At 120 BPM | At 128 BPM |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **¼** | 0.25 | 0.125 s | 0.117 s |
| **½** | 0.5  | 0.250 s | 0.234 s |
| **1** | 1    | 0.500 s | 0.469 s |
| **2** | 2    | 1.000 s | 0.938 s |
| **4** | 4    | 2.000 s | 1.875 s |

The tooltip on each button shows the exact seconds value for the current BPM.

### Show file format (BPM field)

The `bpm` key is stored at the top level of the show JSON and is backward
compatible — older show files without it default to 120 in the editor.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "bpm": 128,
  "media": { "type": "video", "src": "my-show.mov", "duration": 185.2 },
  "tracks": [ ... ]
}
```

### Example: four-beat strobe at 128 BPM

1. Click **+ Strobe** at the desired playhead position.
2. Select the new clip; it defaults to 2 s / 10 Hz / white.
3. In the properties bar click **4** in the beats row → Duration becomes 1.875 s (4 beats at 128 BPM).
4. Change Rate (Hz) to `8` for a slightly slower strobe.
5. Save the show.

## Device viewport preview

### Overview

The **Preview** panel (left of the media area) renders an accurate scale-to-fit
representation of how the show will appear on a real phone screen.  The inner
canvas is sized to the **logical pixel dimensions** of the selected device and
then scaled down to fit the available panel space while preserving the aspect
ratio.

The preview panel is **280 px wide** and the media area is **480 px tall** by
default, giving a large, easy-to-read view of the phone screen on most desktop
displays.

This means that font sizes, padding, and element proportions in the preview
match the client device exactly — content that fits on one line on an iPhone 14
will also fit on one line in the preview.

### Selecting a device preset

Click the **preset dropdown** in the preview panel header to choose a device:

| Preset | Logical size (portrait) |
|--------|------------------------|
| iPhone SE | 375 × 667 |
| **iPhone 14** *(default)* | 390 × 844 |
| iPhone 14 Plus | 428 × 926 |
| iPhone 14 Pro Max | 430 × 932 |
| iPhone 15 Pro | 393 × 852 |
| iPhone 16 Pro Max | 440 × 956 |
| Android S | 360 × 800 |
| Android M — Pixel 7 | 412 × 915 |
| Android L — S22 Ultra | 384 × 854 |

The active dimensions (width × height) are shown to the right of the dropdown.

### Orientation toggle

Click the **↻** button to switch between portrait and landscape.  The device
dimensions are swapped (width ↔ height) and the preview is redrawn immediately.
Click again to return to portrait.

### WYSIWYG font-size behaviour

Text clip **Size (vmin)** values are translated to device-pixel sizes in the
preview:

```
preview_font_px = (size_vmin / 100) × min(device_width, device_height)
```

For example, `Size = 5` on an iPhone 14 portrait (390 × 844) renders as:

```
5 / 100 × 390 = 19.5 px
```

On the real client device the browser interprets `5vmin` identically (since
`1vmin = 1 % of the viewport's shorter dimension`), so the preview is a true
pixel-for-pixel representation.

> **Note:** minor rendering differences (subpixel font hinting, OS default
> font metrics) may cause slight visual variations between the preview and a
> physical device, but proportions and line-breaking behaviour will be accurate.

---

## Link support in text clips

Text clips can optionally include a **Link URL** so that the text appears as a
clickable hyperlink on the client device.

### Adding a link

1. Select a **text** clip on the timeline.
2. In the properties bar, fill in the **Link URL** field with a full URL:
   - `https://example.com`
   - `mailto:user@example.com`
   - `tel:+441234567890`
3. Press **Tab** or **Enter** — the URL is validated immediately.
   - Invalid or unsafe URLs (including `javascript:`) are silently rejected and
     the field is cleared.

### Removing a link

Clear the **Link URL** field and press **Tab** or **Enter**.  The `link_url`
key is removed from the clip's `params` object.

### Allowed URL schemes

| Scheme | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `https:` | `https://example.com/page` | Standard secure web link |
| `http:` | `http://192.168.1.10:8000/` | Plain web link (LAN / internal) |
| `mailto:` | `mailto:band@venue.com` | Opens email client |
| `tel:` | `tel:+441234567890` | Opens phone dialler |

All other schemes (including `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`) are rejected.

### Show file format (link_url field)

The link URL is stored inside the clip's `params` object:

```json
{
  "id": "def67890",
  "type": "text",
  "start": 13.0,
  "duration": 2.0,
  "params": {
    "text": "Visit our site",
    "color": "#ffffff",
    "size": 5,
    "link_url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "fade_in": 0.1,
  "fade_out": 0.2
}
```

Clips without a `link_url` key render as plain text (backward compatible).

### Client-side rendering

On the live show-sync client (`join.html` / `client.js`), text clips with a
`link_url` are rendered as:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" style="color:#ffffff;text-decoration:underline;">
  Visit our site
</a>
```

The anchor is styled with `color: inherit` so it picks up the clip's text colour,
and `text-decoration: underline` to indicate it is clickable.

---

## Zoom

Use the **Zoom − / +** buttons in the timeline toolbar to increase or decrease
the pixels-per-second scale.  The default is 50 px/s.

---

## Exporting (saving) the show file

Click **Save Show** (or press **Ctrl+S** / **⌘S**) to download the show as a
`.json` file.

If the editor was opened with an existing file on the command line, it will
attempt to save back to that path via the server; otherwise it triggers a
browser download.

### Show file format (v2)

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "media": {
    "type": "video",
    "src": "my-show.mov",
    "duration": 185.2
  },
  "tracks": [
    {
      "id": "t1",
      "name": "Solids",
      "layer": 1,
      "clips": [
        {
          "id": "abc12345",
          "type": "color",
          "start": 12.2,
          "duration": 3.5,
          "params": { "color": "#ff0000" },
          "fade_in": 0.2,
          "fade_out": 0.5
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "t2",
      "name": "Text",
      "layer": 10,
      "clips": [
        {
          "id": "def67890",
          "type": "text",
          "start": 13.0,
          "duration": 2.0,
          "params": { "text": "GO", "color": "#ffffff", "size": 5 },
          "fade_in": 0.1,
          "fade_out": 0.2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Importing (loading) a show file

Click **Load Show** and choose a `.json` file.

The editor supports both:
- **v2 format** (tracks + clips, as above)
- **v1 legacy format** (flat `"effects"` list from the old Tkinter editor) —
  automatically migrated to v2 on load.

---

## Playing a show back through show-sync

### 1 — Start the show-sync server

```bash
cd show-sync
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2 — Create a session

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/session \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name": "my-show"}'
# → {"session_id": "a1b2c3d4", "join_url": "/join/a1b2c3d4"}
```

### 3 — Open the join URL on client devices

```
http://<server-ip>:8000/join/a1b2c3d4
```

### 4a — Timeline playback (v2, recommended)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/session/a1b2c3d4/play-timeline?offset=5" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @my-show.json
```

The server broadcasts `show_load` + `show_start` to all connected clients.
Each client runs its own rAF composite loop, evaluating clips at the
synchronised show time.

### 4c — Play a show by name (from the shows library)

Place exported show JSON files in `show-sync/app/static/shows/`.  They are
served statically and can be triggered by name without uploading the JSON body
on each call — ideal for scripted control from `live_controller`.

**List available shows:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/shows
# → {"shows": ["A_storm_is_coming.json", "outro.json"]}
```

**Trigger a named show (legacy relative offset):**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/session/a1b2c3d4/play-show-by-name?name=A_storm_is_coming.json&offset=5"
```

**Trigger a named show with absolute-time scheduling (recommended):**

Pass `start_at` as a Unix timestamp (seconds, float) for the exact wall-clock
moment when show time = 0 begins.  Both the server and all clients wait until
that instant before starting the animation loop, eliminating the network-latency
error that accumulates with a relative offset.

```bash
# start_at = Unix timestamp 2 seconds in the future
START=$(python -c "import time; print(f'{time.time()+2:.6f}')")
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/session/a1b2c3d4/play-show-by-name?name=A_storm_is_coming.json&start_at=$START"
```

`live_controller` uses this mode automatically for all sync-enabled setlist
items.  It computes `target_start = now + preload_time`, sends the request
with `start_at=target_start`, and starts the local MIDI pre-roll immediately
so the video unpauses at exactly `target_start`.  The pre-roll window
(typically 2–8 s) is sufficient lead time for the HTTP request to arrive via
Tailscale well before show time = 0.

**Preload a show on the client via query parameter:**

Append `?show=<filename>` to the join URL.  The client fetches the show JSON
from `/static/shows/` immediately on load so it is ready before the server
sends `show_start`.

```
http://<server-ip>:8000/join/a1b2c3d4?show=A_storm_is_coming.json
```

### 4b — Legacy cue playback (v1)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/session/a1b2c3d4/play-show?offset=5" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @my-show.json
```

### 5 — Stop the show

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/session/a1b2c3d4/stop
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Space** | Play / Pause |
| **Delete** or **Backspace** | Delete selected clip (or selected marker if no clip is selected) |
| **Ctrl+S** / **⌘S** | Save show |
| **Ctrl+C** / **⌘C** | Copy selected clip (text or solid) |
| **Ctrl+V** / **⌘V** | Paste copied clip at current playhead |
| **m** | Add a marker at the current playhead position |

---

## Copy / Paste clips

1. Click a **text** or **solid/colour** clip to select it.
2. Press **Ctrl+C** (or **⌘C** on Mac) to copy it.
   - The full clip is copied: type, duration, colour, text, size, fade in/out.
3. Seek or play to the position where you want the duplicate.
4. Press **Ctrl+V** (or **⌘V**) to paste.
   - A new clip is placed with its start at the **current playhead position**.
   - All other properties are identical to the original.
   - The pasted clip is automatically selected so you can adjust it immediately.

---

## Timeline markers

Press **`m`** at any time (the timeline does not need to be playing) to drop an amber
marker at the current playback position.

- Markers appear as **amber (yellow) vertical lines** on the timeline ruler and
  on every track lane.
- A small time label is drawn at the top of the ruler for each marker.
- Markers are saved with the show file (`"markers"` key in the JSON).

### Deleting markers

There are two ways to remove a marker:

1. **Inline × button** — hover over the ruler; a small **×** button appears at
   the top of each marker.  Click the **×** to delete that marker immediately.

2. **Click + Delete key** — click on the marker line in the ruler to select it
   (it turns bright orange to confirm selection), then press **Delete** or
   **Backspace** to remove it.

Deleting a marker updates the show state immediately and is reflected in saved
show files on the next **Save Show**.

### Snapping clips to markers

When you **drag** a clip or **resize** it by its handles, the clip's moving edge
will **snap** to the nearest marker if it comes within ~8 px of it at the current
zoom level.

- Moving a clip: the **start edge** snaps to nearby markers.
- Resizing from the left handle: the **start** snaps.
- Resizing from the right handle: the **end** snaps.

This makes it easy to align clip boundaries to musical or visual cue points that
you marked while the show was playing.

> **Tip:** mark cue points first (let the show play, press `m`), then drag clips
> onto those positions — they will lock in cleanly.

## Architecture notes

- `show-sync-editor.py` — Python stdlib HTTP server (no extra dependencies).
- `show-sync-editor.html` — Self-contained browser editor (HTML + CSS + JS).
- `show-sync/app/main.py` — FastAPI server; new `/play-timeline` and `/stop`
  endpoints added alongside the existing `/play-show` legacy endpoint.
- `show-sync/app/static/client.js` — Updated to handle `show_load`,
  `show_start`, `show_stop` messages in addition to the legacy `cue` protocol.
- `show-sync/app/templates/join.html` — Text overlay moved to its own `z-index`
  layer above the colour display; font size is now dynamic per clip.
